The final project of my bachelor degree, mainly focuses on discussing semi-supervised theory in EM algorithm and application on clustering. Also, introduced max-entropy theory to deal with the sensitiveness of initial values for semi-supervised EM. Moreover, implemented several experiments on both simulation numerical data and real data in the life to verify the theories discussed in my paper.
